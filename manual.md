# Manual

## Install on Linux

Install [G19daemon](https://github.com/mortendynamite/g19daemon/releases). After the installation has been suceeded you can run the AppImage that you can dowload from [release page](https://github.com/lonelobo0070/Hardware-Monitor-Applet/releases).

## Install on Windows

Download the Windows installer from the [release page](https://github.com/lonelobo0070/Hardware-Monitor-Applet/releases). Run the installer and follow the steps that are shown on the screen.

## A Created screen gives 'unused'

This message is because the screen is not yet in any track. You can add it by opening the order screen by pressing the 'Order screen' button in the right upper corner of the screen. A dialog will be open and there you can add a created screen to a track.

You need at least one screen in the 'Main track' to show anything on the Logitech LCD.
